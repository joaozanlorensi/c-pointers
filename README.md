# c-pointers
Repository used for studying and recaping some particularities about pointers in C.
## pointers_fundamentals.c:
    Uncomment what you would like to study on main function and make sure to save the file.
    Then, on terminal, type "gcc pointers_fundamentals.c -o pointers_fundamentals && pointers_fundamentals" to compile and run. 
## pointers_and_structs.c:
    File for future development. I want to create a file which summarizes information specifically about the use of pointers in structs.
