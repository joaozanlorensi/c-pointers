# c-pointers
Repository used for studying and recaping some particularities about pointers in C.
## pointers_fundamentals.c
Uncomment what you would like to study on main function and make sure to save the file.
Then, on terminal, type:
    "gcc pointers_fundamentals.c -o pointers_fundamentals && pointers_fundamentals" to compile and run.
## pointers_and_structs.c
Follow the steps on main function and in the end you'll build a circular list.
On terminal, type:
    "gcc pointers_and_structs.c -o pointers_and_structs && pointers_and_structs" to compile and run.
